Consider various architectures (including wider and deeper neural networks) to model the Toda Lattice

100: wider neural network with 100 nodes
deep: deeper neural network with more layers
smallH: smaller time step when generating vector field samples
wide,patient: wider neural network with more patient stopping criteria
